# Leetcode Data Structures and Algorithms

Collection of some leetcode questions that I solved to learn DSA.

If you are interested to view my DSA notes, I have a seperate repo on GitHub for that [here](https://github.com/AryanK1511/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python).

## Remarks
Feel free to clone this repo and solve some of the questions yourselves to get better practice.
