# Leetcode Data Structures and Algorithms
Collection of some leetcode questions that I solved to learn DSA.

I have documented all the patterns that I learnt while solving questions in the `README.md` files in every chapter.

If you are interested to view my DSA notes, I have a seperate repo on GitHub for that [here](https://github.com/AryanK1511/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python).
